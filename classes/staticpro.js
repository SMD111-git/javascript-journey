/*In JavaScript, the `static` keyword is used to define static methods or properties in a **class**. It is important to note that `static` does **not** block or interrupt code execution. Instead, it is a way to define methods or properties that belong to the class itself, rather than instances of the class.

### Key Points about `static` in JavaScript:
1. **Static Methods**: These are methods that can be called on the class itself, not on instances of the class.
2. **Static Properties**: These are properties that belong to the class itself, not individual instances.

### Example of Static Methods and Properties:
```javascript
class MyClass {
  static staticProperty = 'I belong to the class, not instances';

  static staticMethod() {
    console.log('This is a static method');
  }

  instanceMethod() {
    console.log('This is an instance method');
  }
}

// Accessing static method and property
console.log(MyClass.staticProperty); // Output: I belong to the class, not instances
MyClass.staticMethod(); // Output: This is a static method

// Trying to access static method or property from an instance will result in error
const obj = new MyClass();
console.log(obj.staticProperty); // undefined
obj.staticMethod(); // TypeError: obj.staticMethod is not a function
```

### Explanation:
- `staticProperty` and `staticMethod` are static, so they can be accessed directly through the class (`MyClass`) without needing an instance of the class.
- On the other hand, `instanceMethod` is a regular method that must be called on an instance of the class.

### Does `static` block code execution?
No, the `static` keyword does not block code execution. It simply defines methods or properties that are accessible on the class itself, rather than through instances of the class. It behaves like any other JavaScript code: it executes when it is encountered during the runtime of the program, but it doesn't halt or block code from running.*/
